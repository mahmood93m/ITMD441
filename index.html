              <p>When I was a kid, I really wanted to know how to build and create games or applications. Therefore, I followed up on this issue and got some information about that. it was fun. Then I took classes and learned more professionally. 
                 Right now I have some programming experience, such as design websites, Mobile App..  </p>
              
              <p>It was a little bit complicated, but I enjoyed learning JavaScript, Node JS, cloud computing and Docker containers at Valqari Company during the summer. As a matter of fact, I got an offer from the company to hire me as a Software Engineer, 
                so I'm now working on front-end mobile apps at this company, so I'm designing mobile apps and websites using Reacts.JS and React Native frameworks, both of which allow me to build JavaScript applications and websites.</p>
